ToDOs:
- add rooms with unlimited time?? so site doesnt look empty when testers test it
- add popup (Snackbar) to indicate you cant join if a room is full / conversation started (instead of the ugly roomFull page)
- the first time a user creates a room, add a tutorial about being a moderator

# TONY:
V HTTPS protocol transform
- use the server data to indicate whether a user is already entered to a room and restrict him to enter multiple rooms
- refresh should return to room/conversation
- make teams balanced (for example if roomSize=5 limit 3 people per team)
- fix welcome username


# IDO:
- refresh on LoginStage not delete the user - need to fix it
- PDF
- add tutorial when joining a room for the first time (explain how to move teams, spectator, ban system, ready check)
