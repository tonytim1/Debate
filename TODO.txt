ToDOs:

- Clean all unnecessary shit in the project without breaking the website (template files, pictures, and so on)
- Move the rooms managment to the server and not on the firebase
- Have a functioning video chat

- Remove nav bar and add somthing else (we need to decide)

- BUG: if a user is in a room and get in the website it takes him to the home page again. we need it to navigate him to the room page. maybe add a "room" field to a user so we know the user's state at every moment
- Add a feature that if a room is full but spectators are allowed then add to the spec list
- Add a feature to chat that if you press 'enter' it sends the msg
- FOR MISLTONE 3 PRESENTATION : maybe 'make' a survey to see demand on the platform
- Add team names feature to the moderator
