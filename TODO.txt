ToDOs:
- add rooms with unlimited time?? so site doesnt look empty when testers test it
- add popup (Snackbar) to indicate you cant join if a room is full / conversation started (instead of the ugly roomFull page)
- the first time a user creates a room, add a tutorial about being a moderator

# TONY:
V HTTPS protocol transform
- use the server data to indicate whether a user is already entered to a room and restrict him to enter multiple rooms
- refresh should return to room/conversation
- make teams balanced (for example if roomSize=5 limit 3 people per team)
- fix welcome username


# IDO:
V add field "EverConnected" [bool] to the firebase user data to welcome the new user and give tutorial (show rules of the web)
V design sign up pages + save profile image
V delete from storage when delete user
V check what happend after delete user and the storage delete.. somehow the url still active.(check user ido1@gmail.com pass:222222)
V fix profile page in the imagesection + enable the "Name" field for google/facebook account
V routes for user/userId need to restrict other users
V joining a room when not logged in should popup login instead of stuck on loading screen - homepage back pop up login window
    V check if can delete useAuthentication()
- refresh on LoginStage not delete the user - need to fix it
- PDF
- improve tutorial on first signup (add more info on how to use the site)
- add tutorial when joining a room for the first time (explain how to move teams, spectator, ban system, ready check)
- if user is banned popup notification for him (Snackbar)
- user need to be expire token


# OMER:
- vidoe start after the timer ends
- pop up window for spectators when conversation is closed
- Clean all unnecessary shit in the project without breaking the website (template files, pictures, and so on)

# ASAF:
V when you report on someone "Snackbar" mui need to explain the action
V kind of debate logic - the user can choose if he wants "free style" debate or "program debate" (2 min for knowledge the team, 10 min for the "pros", 10 min for "against", ...)
V (need to check) - If (room is full or conversation started) and doesn't allow spectators - dont show in home page (or show in the end)
