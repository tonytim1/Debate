ToDOs:
- Clean all unnecessary shit in the project without breaking the website (template files, pictures, and so on)
- BUG: if a user is in a room and get in the website it takes him to the home page again. we need it to navigate him to the room page. maybe add a "room" field to a user so we know the user's state at every moment
    - another option (probably easier) is if a user is in a room and wants to leave the page, add a popup saying leaving the page will leave the room (With Leave, Cancel buttons or something)
- Add a feature that if a room is full but spectators are allowed then add to the spec list
- Add a feature to chat that if you press 'enter' it sends the msg
- FOR MISLTONE 3 PRESENTATION : maybe 'make' a survey to see demand on the platform
- Add team names feature to the moderator (in the create room page)
- Make the room page prettier
- Implement a custom sort to rooms in the home page based on user favorite topics (in the frontend side...)
    - Maybe make buttons like "Top", "Recommended", "Starting Soon" that change rooms sort in home page
- If (room is full or conversation started) and doesn't allow spectators - dont show in home page (or show in the end)
- More Video chat stuff:
    - make video chat room prettier (change the layout...)
    - make website in https to allow joining from other devices
    - add a time checker that starts the conversation when time reaches 0
    - add an option for conversation length, and destroy conversation when time reaches 0
