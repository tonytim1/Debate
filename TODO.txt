ToDOs:


# TONY:
- HTTPS protocol transform
- use the server data to indicate whether a user is already entered to a room and restrict him to enter multiple rooms

# IDO:
- add field "EverConnected" [bool] to the firebase user data to welcome the new user and give tutorial (show rules of the web)
- joining a room when not logged in should popup login instead of stuck on loading screen - homepage back pop up login window
- design sign up pages + save profile image
- delete from storage when delete user
- check what happend after delete user and the storage delete.. somehow the url still active.(check user ido1@gmail.com pass:222222)
- fix profile page in the imagesection + enable the "Name" field for google/facebook account

# OMER:
- vidoe start after the timer ends
- pop up window for spectators when conversation is closed
- Clean all unnecessary shit in the project without breaking the website (template files, pictures, and so on)

# ASAF:
- limit the room capacity (after prod - test max limit) and make both side balanced 
- when you report on someone "Snackbar" mui need to explain the action
- kind of debate logic - the user can choose if he wants "free style" debate or "program debate" (2 min for knowledge the team, 10 min for the "pros", 10 min for "against", ...)
? (need to check) - If (room is full or conversation started) and doesn't allow spectators - dont show in home page (or show in the end)



# OLD ASAF
V Remove nav bar and add somthing else (we need to decide)
V home page: when scrolling for more rooms it should move only the room cards and not the whole page
V Create a landing page for explaining about the website and log in
V Make the room cards (in the home page) more informative (add pics, users icon, fix text alignment)
V make the whole room card (in home page) clickable rather then just the text
V Add a feature to chat that if you press 'enter' it sends the msg
V Make the room page prettier
V add a "be a spectator" button & add a "be a debator"
    - "be debator" should show only if number of current debators is smaller than room size, maybe we should show "2/4" also inside the room
V Add team names feature to the moderator (in the create room page)
