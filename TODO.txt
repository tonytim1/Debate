ToDOs:
- add default rooms
- joining a room when not logged in should popup login instead of stuck on loading screen
- pop up window for spectators when conversation is closed
- If (room is full or conversation started) and doesn't allow spectators - dont show in home page (or show in the end)
- make video chat room prettier (change the layout...)


for next phase maybe:
    - make website in https to allow joining from other devices
    - add a time checker that starts the conversation when time reaches 0
    - add an option for conversation length, and destroy conversation when time reaches 0
    - Clean all unnecessary shit in the project without breaking the website (template files, pictures, and so on)


# TONY:
V Fix clients make multiple socket connections to the server
V Move the rooms managment to the server and not on the firebase
V Add a feature that if a room is full but spectators are allowed then add to the spec list

V Have a functioning video chat:
    V Have inital video working
    V Handle users who leave/disconnect in the middle
    V Handle users who join a conversation that already started (make him a spectator)
    V Fix issue where users call every other user resulting 2 streams between a pair of users


# IDO:
V design login 
- design sign up pages
V Fix account page
- Add a profile picture feature (see it on Home, Room, Conversation pages)
V in login page remove this profile icon
V add facebook/google login/signup options
- BUG: if a user is in a room and get in the website it takes him to the home page again. we need it to navigate him to the room page. maybe add a "room" field to a user so we know the user's state at every moment


# OMER:
- Add reporting system
- Implement a custom sort to rooms in the home page based on user favorite topics (in the frontend side...)
    - Maybe make buttons like "Top", "Recommended", "Starting Soon" that change rooms sort in home page


# ASAF:
V Remove nav bar and add somthing else (we need to decide)
V home page: when scrolling for more rooms it should move only the room cards and not the whole page
V Create a landing page for explaining about the website and log in
V Make the room cards (in the home page) more informative (add pics, users icon, fix text alignment)
V make the whole room card (in home page) clickable rather then just the text
V Add a feature to chat that if you press 'enter' it sends the msg
V Make the room page prettier
V add a "be a spectator" button & add a "be a debator"
    - "be debator" should show only if number of current debators is smaller than room size, maybe we should show "2/4" also inside the room
V Add team names feature to the moderator (in the create room page)
